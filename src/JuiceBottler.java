/**
 * Juice Bottler Lab
 * The lab was created as an exercise to increase the knowledge of multiprocessing,
 * multithreading, thread safe techniques, data parallelization, and task parallelization.
 * The Juice Bottler lab is based off a plant assemble line that takes an orange from fetching,
 * peeling, squeezing, processed, and bottling for sale. The class is the runnable class and runs the main program.
 * It also:
 *          Creates the Plants objects (Three in my version).
 *          Sets the amount of time that the plants will work.
 *          Informs the user of the plantï¿½s phases:
 *             a. Plant open.
 *             b. Plant operating.
 *             c. Plant closed.
 *          Informs the user the total orange production for each state:
 *             a. Total fetched.
 *             b. Total peeled.
 *             c. Total squeezed.
 *             d. Total Bottled.
 *             e. Total Processed.
 *             f. Total Wasted (orange that didn't make it into a finished bottle)
